# 🫀 Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning

This project uses machine learning techniques to predict the likelihood of heart disease in patients based on various health attributes.

## 📁 Project Files

- `Heart_Disease.ipynb` — The Jupyter notebook containing data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- `heart_disease(q).csv` *(or your dataset name)* — Dataset containing patient health records.

## 🧠 Features Used

- Age  
- Sex  
- Chest Pain Type  
- Resting Blood Pressure  
- Cholesterol  
- Fasting Blood Sugar  
- Maximum Heart Rate Achieved  
- Exercise Induced Angina  
- ST Depression (oldpeak)  
- Number of Major Vessels  
- Thalassemia Type  

## 🔍 Models Applied

- Logistic Regression  
- Decision Tree  
- Random Forest  
- K-Nearest Neighbors  
- Accuracy and confusion matrix metrics for evaluation

## 📊 Results

The best-performing model achieved an accuracy of around **XX%**. *(Update with your actual result)*

## 📌 Future Improvements

- Hyperparameter tuning  
- Try deep learning models  
- Deploy as a web app using Flask/Streamlit
